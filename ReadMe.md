**Object Detection - Face Mask Detection**
With the prevalence of COVID-19, in order to control its spread, an algorithm to detect if one is wearing
a facial mask is important. This repository contains code for object detection to detect the proper usage of masks by individuals.

There are three classes in this dataset - 
1) With mask;
2) Without mask;
3) Mask worn incorrectly

Two different algorithms were tested - 
1) FASTER-RCNN
2) YOLO v5

**Examples from Dataset:**
